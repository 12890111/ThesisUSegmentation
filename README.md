The deep learning book contains the code that is used to load in, pre process and train the model and dataset. The CodeAppendix contains functions that have been used througout model training for different setups.
Evauluation for the different models can be found in the model performances file.

The best scoring model is model 104 consiting of the attention U-net model using no data augmentation.
All model files and the segmentations have been uploaded to the onderdive due to their big size.
